# AILife

AILife is a simulation tool that models an artificial life ecosystem where two types of creatures, **Prey** and **Predator**, interact in a 2D environment. This project uses neural networks for creature behavior and tracks the population dynamics between these two species over time. The project allows creatures to move, interact, and evolve based on basic rules and energy constraints, simulating survival of the fittest scenarios.

## Features

- **Neural Network Driven Behavior**: Each creature uses a neural network to make decisions like movement and direction changes based on its surroundings.
- **Prey and Predator Simulation**: Both prey and predator creatures interact based on specific rules such as predation, energy consumption, and reproduction.
- **Energy and Movement**: Creatures lose energy over time, and predators gain energy by hunting prey. Reproduction is triggered based on specific conditions.
- **Raycasting for Vision**: Creatures "see" their environment using raycasting techniques, which informs their decisions about movement and interaction with other creatures.
- **Visualization**: The simulation outputs data that can be used to visualize population dynamics over time using plots, showing the rise and fall of prey and predator populations.
